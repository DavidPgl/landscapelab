# Setup

(First: Setup the [retour-middleware](https://github.com/boku-ilen/retour-middleware))

* Folder `Assets` goes into `retour-client\` (same folder as `Scenes`, `Scripts`, ...)
* Open the Godot project (importing can take a long time and seem like it's stuck, but it'll finish eventually)
* Run the retour-middleware
* Run the main scene
