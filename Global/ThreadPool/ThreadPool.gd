extends Node

#
# Since starting a thread is expensive (it causes noticeable stutters), this
# singleton provides pre-started threads which you can delegate work to.
# Starting a function in one of these pooled threads is non-blocking.
#
# Note that nodes which have active enqueued tasks in the ThreadPool may not be
# freed until all these functions are done - otherwise, they may be freed while
# the method is still being executed in a thread, causing a crash!
